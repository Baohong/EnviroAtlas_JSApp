				<p>The Raindrop tool allows users to interactively select a location
					on the map to locate the general raindrop flow path and distance
					to the nearest water feature as depicted in National Hydrography
					Dataset Plus V2 (NHDPlus V2). This tool is a prototype for testing only.
					Warning: This tool is built using nationally available 30 meter elevation
					data; it does not account for buildings or engineered stormwater
					infrastructure such as culverts and pipes and as such is not for
					use in heavily engineered locations. For additional guidance on
					this tool, please see the About EnviroAtlas document - accessible
					from the map viewer Help button.</p>

      The <strong>Raindrop </strong>tool generates a flow path and calculates the distance from an interactively selected point on the map to the nearest water feature in the <a href="https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/enviroatlas/DataFactSheets/pdf/Supplemental/NationalHydrographyDataset.pdf" class="demoLink">National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus)</a>. The flow path follows topographical features in an underlying digital elevation model (DEM). The tool pop-up window includes three tabs: <strong>About</strong>, <strong>Results</strong>, and <strong>Settings</strong>.
   </p>
   </br>
   <p>
      <em>Note: Consider displaying the NHDPlus V2 features layer group while using this tool to provide context about the hydrologic network.
   </p>
   </br>
   <p>
      To use the <strong>Raindrop </strong>tool with default settings:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         click the <strong>Activate Tool</strong> button,
      </li>
      <li>
         move the mouse pointer over the location of interest on the map and click.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      The tool returns a red point at the location of interest and a line showing the flow path of water from the location of interest to the nearest NHDPlus V2 water body or flowline.
   </p>
   </br>
   <p>
      <em>Note: </em><strong>Select Point(s)</strong><em>remains active until the button is clicked again, at which point the tool is deactivated.</em>
   </p>
   </br>
   <p>
      Click the <strong>Results</strong> tab to find the path distance from the selected point to the nearest NHDPlus water body.
   </p>
   <p>
      To remove the graphic features from the map, click the <strong>Clear</strong> button.
   </p>
   </br>
   <p>
      <strong>Raindrop </strong>tool settings may be adjusted to improve results. Click on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab to access these:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <strong>Max Distance (km):</strong> Use the slider bar to set the maximum distance the raindrop will travel along the flow path, from 0 to 5 kilometers. The default is 5 kilometers.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Snap Distance (km):</strong> Use the slider bar to set the distance the raindrop tool will search for the nearest NHD feature after traveling the Max Distance. The default snap distance is 5 kilometers.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Line Thickness and Color:</strong> Use the slider bar to set the line thickness. Click the color box to select the line color.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Once the settings are adjusted, use the <strong>Select Raindrop Point</strong> button and click on the location of interest.

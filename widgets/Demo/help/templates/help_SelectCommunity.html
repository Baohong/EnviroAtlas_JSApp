   <p>
      EnviroAtlas community data are developed from high resolution land cover (1 meter) and census data for featured urban areas in the U.S.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
      Use this widget to change the legend of your community maps.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
      &#183;  Select a community to see a legend for that community's data only.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
      &#183;  Use \"Combined Communities\" to see a legend based on all communities (i.e., comparable across all communities)

   <p>Community layers are indicated in the Layer Filter/Search Panel results area by a geographic extent icon marked with a &ldquo;C.&rdquo; Selecting a community layer from the results area prompts an option to choose a specific EnviroAtlas community before exploring the layers in the map.</p>
<p>Two actions occur when this layer is selected:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Layer List pop-up appears, listing the operational layers. One of the operational layers is the selected layer (&ldquo;Acute respiratory&hellip;&rdquo;). The other operational layer is the &ldquo;EnviroAtlas Community Boundaries.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The EnviroAtlas communities are displayed in the Map Panel as blue points.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, a choice may be made to continue to view all communities (as indicated by the &ldquo;Selected Community: Combined Communities&rdquo; text in the upper left corner of the map), or to narrow the focus to a single community.</p>
<p>When choosing to continue to view all communities combined, no special action needs to be taken. Continue with map exploration.</p>
<p>If desired, select one EnviroAtlas community to focus on. The selection may be performed interactively from the map, or by using the <a href="#_Community_Selection">Community Selection</a> tool. To interactively select the EnviroAtlas community from the map, simply click on the circle representing the community desired. A pop-up appears with a button to <strong>Select this community</strong>. Click the button to change the extent of the map to the community.</p>
<p><em>Note: </em><em>Selecting the community from the Community Selection tool also zooms the map to the community.</em></p>
<p>Once a community is selected, map symbology and the legend are tailored to display the data classifications for the selected community only, the name of which is displayed prominently in the upper left corner of the Map Panel.</p>
<p>When a single EnviroAtlas community is selected, the symbology and appearance for all subsequent community layers selected are tailored to that community. To select a new community, open the <a href="#_Community_Selection">Community Selection</a> tool and choose a different community or select &ldquo;Combined Communities&rdquo; to return to viewing the symbology for all communities.</p>

   <div><img style='width:330px' src='widgets/Demo/images/elev_img.jpg'></div>  <p>The <strong>Elevation Profile</strong> tool generates an elevation profile graph based on a transect line interactively drawn in the map. The elevation data are reported in units above mean sea level and are based on topographic data collected by the <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/">NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)</a>.</p>
<p>To generate an elevation profile, perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Measure tool button from the Measure tab in the Elevation Profile pop-up.</li>
<li>The units dropdown appears to the right of the Measure tool and provides a selection of measurement units. Select the measurement units.</li>
<li>Create the transect line in the map. Click once at the desired beginning point of the profile transect. Multiple points may be added along the transect.</li>
<li>At the ending point of the transect, double click.</li>
</ol>
<p>The transect will appear as a blue line with markers indicating the beginning and ending points of the profile transect.</p>
<p>Upon completing the transect, the elevation profile graph displays in the Profile Result tab in the Elevation Profile pop-up. Hover the mouse pointer over the profile graph to see the distance along the profile and the elevation value at a particular point, marked with a red X. The red X also appears along the transect line showing the relationship between the graph and the location on the map. Hover over the <strong>blue circular </strong>&ldquo;<strong>i</strong>&rdquo; <strong>icon</strong> (Profile Information) in the pop-up to get statistics about the profile.</p>

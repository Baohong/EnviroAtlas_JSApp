   <h1>HUC Navigation</h1>
<p>The <strong>HUC Navigation</strong> tool allows users to click on any location in the conterminous US, navigate to the nearest stream, and select 12-digit HUC (hydrologicnit code) subwatersheds within the stream network. Either upstream or downstream HUCs may be selected, and selected HUCs may be limited by distance (stream kilometers) from the interactively-selected point and/or a maximum number of HUCs.</p>
<p>To select HUCs within the stream network, perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Settings tab.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Up</strong> or <strong>Down</strong></li>
<li>Using the slider, select the maximum <strong>Distance (km)</strong> to travel in stream kilometers. Upstream or downstream HUCs that lie beyond this set value will not be selected. The maximum value allowed is 250 km.</li>
<li>Using the slider, select the <strong>Maximum number of 12-digit HUCs</strong> to select. The maximum value allowed is 100 HUCs.</li>
<li>Optional: Check the box to <a href="#_Save_and_Download"><strong>Select to Save HUC Shapefile</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Click the Results tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Activate Tool</strong>, move the mouse crosshairs (+) to the desired map location to begin the HUC selection, and click on the map.</li>
<li>Optional: If the option to save the shapefile was selected in Step 5, a <a href="#_Save_and_Download"><strong>Download HUC Shapefile</strong></a> button appears in the Results tab after the HUCs have been generated in the map. Click to obtain a GIS shapefile of selected HUCs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The status of the query is displayed in the white text box in the Results tab while the HUCs are generating. Please note, the further the distance or the greater number of HUCs selected increases processing time. The query results display in the map as shaded HUC polygons along the stream course.</p>
<p><em>Note: The selection tool remains active while the mouse pointer shows the crosshairs. To return to EnviroAtlas map functions, click the </em><strong>Select Point</strong><em> button to deactivate the selection tool. The mouse pointer reverts to a pointer arrow. </em></p>

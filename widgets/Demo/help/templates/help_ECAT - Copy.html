<p>There are three Layer Filter/Search Panels in EnviroAtlas. Click the button to limit the search to a particular data type:</p>

<a name="ESBPanel" id="ESBPanel"><h4>Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity layers</h4>
	<img alt="GR-007: Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Panel." src="http://edg-intranet.epa.gov/data/RESTRICTED/OEI/EA_TEMP/GR-007.PNG"></p>

<p>The Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity panel provides tools to search and filter National and Community summarized layers developed specifically for EnviroAtlas and additional non summarized layers created by EnviroAtlas or others. These layers correspond to the geography and topics listed in the top half of the panel.</p>

<p>Most of the National layers are summarized by 12-digit hydrological unit code (HUC) for the conterminous 48 United States. EPA and EnviroAtlas partners have developed these layers to help governments, researchers, and other interested parties understand the status and impacts of Ecosystem Services within a watershed or region.</p>

<p>Community layers are summarized by US Census Bureau block group and are designed to be used in conjunction with the National layers. The defined boundaries for the community are based on selected block groups within the 2010 US Census Bureau Urban Area boundary for the community. New community layers are regularly created and added to EnviroAtlas.</p>

<p>Non-summarized data layers are available in many National and Community topics such as Ecosystem Markets, Land Cover: Type, Landscape Patterns, or Impaired Waters.</p>

<p>Click the toggle switch next to the geography or topic to the "on" position to view corresponding layers. Click a switch "off" to exclude layers. Toggle switches may be turned on or off at any time to include or exclude layers.</p>

<p>The geography toggle switches (National and EnviroAtlas Communities) are in the "on" position when the interactive map is opened. When a geography toggle is switched off, some topic toggle switches below become grayed out, indicating that no layers in that topic correspond to the geography selected.</p>

<p>All topic toggle switches are off by default when the interactive map is opened. Switch a topic toggle to the "on" position to display a list of layers corresponding to that topic in the results at the bottom of the panel.</p>

	<img alt="GR-008: ESB Panel Activated 1." src="http://edg-intranet.epa.gov/data/RESTRICTED/OEI/EA_TEMP/GR-008.PNG"></p>

<p>The example above shows the Carbon Storage topic toggle switched to the "on" position. The layers that correspond with that topic are displayed in the results. There are six layers, as indicated by the layer count in the status bar above the results.</p>

<ul><mark><strong><em>TIP:</strong> The layer list in the results may be compressed by clicking the topic name (i.e., "Carbon Storage"). This collapses all layers within the topic category. Click the topic category name to reveal the list. Similarly, to see a longer list of filtered names, clicking the "Filter EnviroAtlas Data by Geography|Topic" name can be collapsed to allow only the filtered layers to be visible.</em></mark><br></ul>

<p>If desired, the search box below the toggle switches may be used instead of the toggle switches for searching and filtering EnviroAtlas layers. Enter a search term or phrase (such as "forest" or "tree cover") in the search box.</p>

</p><em>Note: Using the search option overrides the toggle switch settings and displays all ecosystem services and biodiversity layers that match the search terms. Once the search key word is deleted, the selected toggles will be restored.</em></p>
	
<p><strong><em>Layer information found in the Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Panel results</em></strong></p>

<p>The results provide information about the layers in the list:</p>
	<img alt="GR-009: Layer information in the results." src="http://edg-intranet.epa.gov/data/RESTRICTED/OEI/EA_TEMP/GR-009.PNG"></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Layer count</strong> - number of layers in the results that correspond to the topics/geography selected.</li>
	<li><strong>Topic name</strong> - name of the topic from the toggle above. Each topic toggle switched on will display.</li>
	<li><strong>Layer name (some with units selection)</strong> - name of the layer. Some layers have a selection of units that provide different ways to visualize the data layer. For example, "Carbon stored by tree cover" may be viewed in the map as total volume in metric tonnes per year, as a value in U.S. dollars per year, or both. Hover the mouse cursor over the name of the layer in the results to view a short description of the layer.</li>
	<li><strong>Ecosystem services category icons</strong> - indicate to which of the seven EnviroAtlas ecosystem services benefit categories the layer belongs. A layer belongs to an ecosystem services category when the icon is colored, otherwise the icon is grayed. In the Carbon Storage example above, the resulting layers all belong to the Climate Stabilization ecosystem services category, as indicated by the orange coloration of the Climate Stabilization icon. Some layers are associated with multiple ecosystem service categories. The categories represented by the icons are (left to right):</li>
	<img alt="GR-010: Ecosystem services category icons." src="http://edg-intranet.epa.gov/data/RESTRICTED/OEI/EA_TEMP/GR-010.PNG">
		<ul><li>Clean Air</li>
			<li>Clean and Plentiful Water</li>
			<li>Climate Stabilization</li>
			<li>Natural Hazard Mitigation</li>
			<li>Recreation, Culture, and Aesthetics</li>
			<li>Food, Fuel, and Materials</li>
			<li>Biodiversity Conservation</li>
		</ul>
		<em><mark><strong>TIP:</strong> Clicking on a category icon in the interactive map opens a graphic and text describing the specific category.</mark></em>
	<li><strong>Data type icons</strong> - indicate the type or format of the layer as displayed in the map. The types/formats represented by the icons are (left to right):</li>
	<img alt="GR-011: Data type icons." src="http://edg-intranet.epa.gov/data/RESTRICTED/OEI/EA_TEMP/GR-011.PNG">
		<ul><li>Data summarized by census block groups</li>
			<li>Data summarized by 12 ditit HUCs</li>
			<li>Non-summarized grid data</li>
			<li>Point, line, or polygon data</li>
		</ul>
	<li><strong>Geographic extent icon</strong> - indicates whether the layer is a national layer ("N") or a community layer ("C"). When selected, community layers prompt a workflow option to select an EnviroAtlas community. This is explained in detail in the <a href="#SelectCommLayer">Selecting community layers</a> section.</li>
	<li><strong>Hide icons checkbox</strong> - the ecosystem services category icons below the layer name may be hidden by checking the "Hide Icons" checkbox in the status bar above the results. This compresses the layer list to make more layer names visible.</li>
	<li><strong>Layer description and link to the EnviroAtlas Data Fact sheet</strong>, represented by the circled "i" - click this link to open a pop-up with a short description of the layer and a link to the layer's Data Fact Sheet with considerable details about the layer.</li>

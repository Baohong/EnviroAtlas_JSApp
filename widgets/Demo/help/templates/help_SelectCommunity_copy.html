      EnviroAtlas community data are developed from high resolution land cover (1 meter) and census data for featured U.S. urban areas. Community data layers are represented by a "C" icon in the layer selection panel on the left as well as in the Layer List.
      Your selection controls how the community data layers are displayed in the map as follows:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>Select a community to see a legend for the selected community's data only.</li>
	  <li>Use "Combined Communities" to see a legend based on all communities (i.e., comparable across all communities)</li></ol>

   <br>
   <p>>The EnviroAtlas communities are displayed in the Map Panel as blue points.</p>
<p>A choice may be made to continue to view all communities (as indicated by the &ldquo;Selected Community: Combined Communities&rdquo; text in the upper left corner of the map), or to narrow the focus to a single community.</p>
  <br>
<p>The selection of a single community may be performed interactively from the map, or by using the Community Selection tool. To interactively select the EnviroAtlas community from the map, simply click on the circle representing the community desired. A pop-up appears with a button to <strong>Select this community</strong>. Click the button to change the extent of the map to the community.</p>
<br>
<p><em>Note: </em><em>Selecting the community from the Community Selection tool also zooms the map to the community.</em></p>
<br>
<p>Once a community is selected, map symbology and the legend are tailored to display the data classifications for the selected community only, the name of which is displayed prominently in the upper left corner of the Map Panel.</p>
<p>When a single EnviroAtlas community is selected, the symbology and appearance for all subsequent community layers selected are tailored to that community.</p>
  <br>
<p>To select a new community, open the Community Selection tool and choose a different community or select &ldquo;Combined Communities&rdquo; to return to viewing the symbology for all communities.</p>

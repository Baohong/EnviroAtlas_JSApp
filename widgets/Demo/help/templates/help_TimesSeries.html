   <h1>Time Series Data Tool</h1>
<p>The Time Series Viewer contains a menu which allows for exploration of historic climate data and modeled future climate scenarios. Selections and/or entries for each menu item provide the variables that control the climate scenario displayed on the map. The variables are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Select Scenario or Historical </strong>&ndash; select the climate model to map a future scenario, or select &ldquo;Historic .&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Select Variable </strong>&ndash; select the variable (maximum or minimum temperature, precipitation, or potential evapotranspiration) to be mapped.</li>
<li><strong>Select Season or Annual</strong> &ndash; select the season to be displayed on the map, or &ldquo;Annual&rdquo; for annual mean values.</li>
<li><strong>Or, select specific year to display</strong> &ndash; enter a specific year to view future or historic climate data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>blue circular </strong>&ldquo;<strong>i</strong>&rdquo; <strong>icon</strong> to the right of each menu item indicates that supporting information is available for the item. Click the icon to reveal detailed information about the available selections or acceptable entries for each menu item.</p>
<p>Once the <strong>Model</strong>, <strong>Metric</strong>, and <strong>Season</strong> have been selected, historic or modeled future climate data that corresponds with those entries may be displayed for either one single year of data or for a sequence of years of data.</p>

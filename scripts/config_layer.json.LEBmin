Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits. Potential wetland areas, as developed for this map, are lands that naturally accumulate water due to topography and have historically had poorly or very poorly draining soils. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as habitat exchanges. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters locations.","DownloadSource":"ftp://newftp.epa.gov/epadatacommons/ORD/EnviroAtlas/Ecosystem_Marketplace_Shapefiles_November2016.zip","layers":[{"popup":{"mediaInfos":[],"fieldInfos":[{"visible":false,"stringFieldOption":"textbox","label":"OBJECTID","tooltip":"","fieldName":"OBJECTID"},{"visible":false,"stringFieldOption":"textbox","label":"Shape","tooltip":"","fieldName":"Shape"},{"visible":true,"stringFieldOption":"textbox","label":"Initiative

Ecosystem Marketplace research. Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as in-lieu fee programs. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters locations.","eaNHM":true,"layers":[{"popup":{"mediaInfos":[],"fieldInfos":[{"visible":false,"stringFieldOption":"textbox","label":"OBJECTID","tooltip":"","fieldName":"OBJECTID"},{"visible":false,"stringFieldOption":"textbox","label":"Shape","tooltip":"","fieldName":"Shape"},{"visible":true,"stringFieldOption":"textbox","label":"Initiative

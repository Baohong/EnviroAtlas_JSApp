Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits.

polygons and points representing the location of markets and projects primarily targeting imperiled species and/or habitat ecosystem services per USACE RIBITS data and Ecosystem Marketplace research. Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as habitat exchanges. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters

contains polygons and points representing the location of markets and projects primarily targeting wetland and stream ecosystem services per USACE RIBITS data and Ecosystem Marketplace research. Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as in-lieu fee programs. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters locations.","url":"https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Other/EcoMarket_wetlandsandstreams/MapServer","sourceType":"plp","DownloadSource":"ftp://newftp.epa.gov/epadatacommons/ORD/EnviroAtlas/Ecosystem_Marketplace_Shapefiles_November2016.zip","eaTags":["water","river","economy","protection","conservation","wetland
